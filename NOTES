ascd        ads

segfault for emty inoput

first step in the tokenization is that you are saving as tokens and the spaces
in the parsing process  if while (token[i][0] != SPACE) strjoin to my agr[i]
is not space
[echo][HOME][][][][$USER][$USER][][]-->[HOME],[$USER$USER]



Tokenization
[SPACE][PIPE][REDIR][APPEND_REDIR][EXP][S_QUOTES][D_QUOTES]
parsing
[COMAND][AGR1][ARG2][ARG3].......[|]
[PIPE 1][PIPE2]...........

$user$user"'$user"

[su[1][3]]
[su[2][4]]
[su[3][1]]


here i want to add the tokenization with $ and make a separate tokenn each whitespace and the single and double quotes untill it finds the closing quote
